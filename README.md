# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Facial emotion recognition using machine learning (4th semester)

Program details:-
KNN model- Samuela_Assignment ML_Emotion_classification_KNN.ipynb
SVM model- Samuela_Assignment ML_Emotion_classification_SVM.ipynb

Features/Bugs/Missing:-
Both models were trained using labelled dataset and tested on unseen unlabelled dataset.
The accuracy of both models when tested on unseen unlabelled dataset is not good and only few images are classified correctly.
It's possible to receive different prediction for same image when run at different times. 

Special instructions:-
When running 1st or 2nd block of code, it'll ask to upload a file. Upload the kaggle.json file given in zip file.
Before running code block for testing unseen unlabelled dataset, the test data given as separate zip file has to be uploaded in your google drive and give permission to colab to access it when it asks for it while running.

Future work:-
Can be used to get live feed from camera and detect stress, anxiety, and happiness levels of a person.
